In a phishing attack, the perpetrator pretends to be a reputable entity or person via email to obtain sensitive information like login credentials. In this case, the attacker disguised as the company's HR by asking employees to update their timesheets. 
Malware is intrusive software designed to harm or exploit computers. In this case, the user executed a phishing attack payload that may have installed malware onto their system. As users cannot open a Word document that they have always been able to open, this could be ransomware or a virus.
